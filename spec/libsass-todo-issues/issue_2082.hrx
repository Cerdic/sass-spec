DEPRECATION WARNING on line 3 of /sass/spec/libsass-issues/issue_2082/input.scss:
#{} interpolation near operators will be simplified in a future version of Sass.
To preserve the current behavior, use quotes:

  unquote('#{$prefix}"-"#{$suffix}')

You can use the sass-convert command to automatically fix most cases.
